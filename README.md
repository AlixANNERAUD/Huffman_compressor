# 📜 Huffman compressor

## 🚀 Introduction

This is a group project for the course "Advanced algorithmic and C programming" at the INSA Rouen Normandie engineering school. The goal of this project was to implement a Huffman compressor in C.

## 🛠️ Compilation

Here are the `make` commands (execute in the `programme` directory) to compile the program:

- `make` or `make all` to compile the program.
- `make clean` to remove the object files.
- `make run` to run the program.
- `make test` to run the tests.
- `make doc` to generate the documentation.

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

To run the executable (`programme/bin/main`), you can use the following command:

- To compress a file:
```bash
./programme/bin/main c [FILE]
```
- To decompress a file:
```bash
./programme/bin/main d [FILE]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When decompressing a file, the file must have the `.huff` extension.
